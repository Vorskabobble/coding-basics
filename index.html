            <h2>Git and GitHub</h2>
            <h3>What is git?</h3>
            <p>
                Git is a tool that is used to manage and version the source
                files to software. It is able to track the changes in a file and
                allows you to commit those changes which is like taking a
                snapshot in time of the code. This can then be revisited,
                compared and even used to overwrite later changes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Git works using repositories which are like a folder on your
                computer. Each repository holds all the files for your project
                and some secret files ðŸ¤« git uses to track the history of the
                repository.
            </p>
            <h3>What is GitHub?</h3>
            <p>
                GitHub is an online tool that hosts git repositories. This
                allows you to collaborate with other people in the same codebase
                easily.

            <h2>Creating a new repository with existing code</h2>
            <p>
                There are two main steps when creating a repository from
                existing code. Turning your existing project into a git repo and
                uploading that to a repo in GitHub which will also need
                creating. A lot of devs and tutorials use the git command line
                interface (CLI) as this is the original git tool. It can however
                be simpler to use a tool such as GitHub Desktop or Visual Studio
                Code.
            </p>

                    <h3>Using VS Code</h3>
                    <p>
                        VS Code has a built in interface for using git which can
                        also be used for initialising repositories and uploading
                        them directly to GitHub. This option will require the
                        git CLI to be installed as that is what VSCode uses
                        under the hood.
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Open the project in VSCode</li>
                        <li>
                            Navigate to the Source Control tab as seen in the
                            image
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Click the the
                                    <q>Initialise Repository</q> button if you
                                    just want to add git
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Click the <q>Publish to Github</q> button to
                                    upload it directly to GitHub. Note the
                                    repository name will be the same as the
                                    folder.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            If you initialised the repo you will have to commit
                            your files and publish it the GitHub. Steps can be
                            found in the next section.

                    <p>
                        The GitHub desktop app can be a bit trickier to use to
                        add git to a new repository. The most fool proof way is
                        documented below but it isn't the only way.

                        <li>
                            Click <q>Add</q> and then

                        </li>
                        <li>A warning will appear stating the folder is not a git repository. Click the <q>create repository</q> link in the warning
